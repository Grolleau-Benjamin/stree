STree is a modern and smart reimplementation of the traditional tree command. Its goal is to provide developers with a more intuitive and visually clear way to explore project structures. Unlike the classic version, STree introduces several improvements such as configurable depth levels for better readability, colorized output to distinguish files and directories at a glance, and automatic filtering of files or folders ignored by Git (based on the .gitignore file). It can also display the Git status of files, showing whether they are untracked, modified, staged for commit, or stashed. STree is written in Rust.

## ðŸš€ Run in development
You can run *Stree* directly from source with Cargo:
```bash
cargo run -- [Options]
```

Example:
```bash
cargo run -- --depth 2 --color always --icons --git
```

This will display the directory tree up to depth 2, with colors, icons, and Git status indicators.

## ðŸ§ª Run tests
All integration tests are located in `./tests/` directory while unit tests are side by side to the file.

To run them:
```bash
cargo test
```

## ðŸ§° Build the binary
To build the project in release mode:
```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be located in:
```
./target/release/stree
```

You can then run it directly:
```bash
./target/release/stree [Options]
```

## ðŸ¦€ Cli Usages
You can display all available arguments using:
```bash
cargo run -- --help
```
